## Core Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Create a worktree** for your feature branch
2. **Start a tmux session** with Claude Code
3. **Develop** with real-time process monitoring
4. **Push and create PR** when ready
5. **Clean up** worktree and session after merge

### Multi-Project Management
