- `internal/cli/interactive.go` - Interactive selection with gum integration
- `internal/cli/progress.go` - Enhanced progress indicators and batch tracking
- `internal/cli/batch.go` - Batch operation management with concurrency control
- `internal/cli/confirmation.go` - Advanced confirmation prompts with impact assessment
- `internal/cli/table.go` - Rich table formatting with themes and styling

**Key Features:**
- Gum-based interactive selection with fallbacks
- Multi-step progress tracking
- Pattern matching and filtering utilities
- Comprehensive confirmation workflows
- Responsive table layouts with color support
- Batch operation validation and error handling

### 4. Shell Completion Support

**Implemented Features:**
- Complete bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell completion
- Dynamic completion for worktree names, session IDs, and branch names
- Context-aware completion with status filtering
- Installation helper command (`completion install-completion`)
- Auto-detection of shell type

### 5. Integration Enhancements

**API Integration:**
- Proper integration with existing git, tmux, and config packages
- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete APIs
- Forward-compatible design for future enhancements
- Consistent error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### API Compatibility

Several planned features were implemented with placeholder functionality due to incomplete APIs in the current codebase:

1. **Claude Code Process Management**: Auto-start and process cleanup features display warnings instead of failing
2. **Advanced Git Operations**: Merge and push commands have basic structure but need full git integration
3. **Session Health Monitoring**: Simplified to basic status checks until full health monitoring is available

### Configuration Integration

Updated configuration access to use correct field names:
- `GitConfig.DirectoryPattern` for worktree directory naming
- `TmuxConfig.NamingPattern` for session naming conventions

### Error Handling

Implemented comprehensive error handling with:
- User-friendly error messages with suggestions
- Graceful degradation when optional features aren't available
- Consistent error reporting across all commands
