- ✅ Pass environment variables (CCMGR_WORKTREE, CCMGR_WORKTREE_BRANCH, CCMGR_NEW_STATE, CCMGR_SESSION_ID)
- ✅ Handle hook script errors gracefully
- ✅ Support async hook execution
- ✅ Worktree creation hooks for bootstrapping new environments
- ✅ Worktree activation hooks for session continuation/resumption
- ✅ Support for isolated execution environments per worktree

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. Hook Types
- **Status Hooks**: `idle`, `busy`, `waiting` - triggered on Claude Code state changes
- **Worktree Hooks**: `creation`, `activation` - triggered during worktree lifecycle events

### 2. Hook Executor (`executor.go`)
- **Synchronous Execution**: With timeout enforcement and proper error handling
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking execution with error reporting channels
- **Concurrency Control**: Semaphore-based limiting (max 5 concurrent hooks)
- **Script Validation**: Existence and permission checks before execution
- **Environment Setup**: Comprehensive environment variable management
- **Cross-Platform**: Shell detection and proper command execution

### 3. Environment Management (`environment.go`)
- **Environment Builder**: Fluent API for building hook environments
- **Standard Variables**: `CCMGR_WORKTREE_PATH`, `CCMGR_WORKTREE_BRANCH`, `CCMGR_PROJECT_NAME`, `CCMGR_SESSION_ID`
- **Legacy Compatibility**: `CCMANAGER_*` variables for backward compatibility
- **Context-Specific Variables**: Different variable sets for different hook types
- **Validation & Sanitization**: Environment key validation and value sanitization

### 4. Error Handling (`errors.go`)
- **Typed Errors**: `TimeoutError`, `ScriptNotFoundError`, `ScriptPermissionError`, `ScriptExecutionError`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Hooks failures don't interrupt main workflow
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry for transient failures
- **Silent Failures**: Status hooks fail silently to maintain UX

### 5. Status Hook Integration (`status.go`)
- **State Change Detection**: Maps process states to hook types
- **Debouncing**: Prevents rapid state change spam (1-second default)
- **Claude Integration**: Handles Claude Code process events
- **Activity Tracking**: Integration with external tools (like skate)

### 6. Worktree Lifecycle Hooks (`worktree.go`)
- **Creation Hooks**: Bootstrap new worktree environments
- **Activation Hooks**: Setup for session start/continue/resume
- **Session Types**: Distinguishes between "new", "continue", and "resume" sessions
- **Project Detection**: Automatic project name extraction from paths

### 7. Hook Manager (`manager.go`)
- **Central Coordination**: Manages all hook types and integrations
- **Configuration Management**: Hot-reloading of configuration changes
- **Enable/Disable Control**: Global and per-hook-type controls
- **Background Services**: Cleanup routines and maintenance tasks
- **Statistics**: Hook execution metrics and monitoring

### 8. Integration Layer (`integration.go`)
- **Global Access**: Singleton pattern for application-wide hook access
- **Event Handling**: Structured event types for different scenarios
- **Convenience Functions**: Simple APIs for common operations
- **Component Integration**: Easy integration with existing ccmgr-ultra components

## Configuration Integration

### Updated Schema (`internal/config/schema.go`)
```go
type WorktreeHooksConfig struct {
    Enabled        bool       `yaml:"enabled" json:"enabled"`
    CreationHook   HookConfig `yaml:"creation" json:"creation"`
    ActivationHook HookConfig `yaml:"activation" json:"activation"`
}
```

### Configuration Template (`internal/config/template.yaml`)
```yaml
# Worktree lifecycle hooks - scripts executed during worktree operations
worktree_hooks:
  enabled: true
  creation:
    enabled: true
    script: "~/.config/ccmgr-ultra/hooks/creation.sh"
    timeout: 300  # 5 minutes for dependency installation
    async: false  # Wait for completion
  activation:
    enabled: true
    script: "~/.config/ccmgr-ultra/hooks/activation.sh"
    timeout: 60
    async: true   # Don't block session start
```

## Hook Script Examples

### Creation Hook (`scripts/hooks/creation.sh.example`)
- **Environment Detection**: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust project support

- **Configuration Copying**: .env files, IDE settings (.vscode, .idea)
- **Service Startup**: Docker Compose services
- **Database Migration**: Automatic migration execution
- **Custom Initialization**: Project-specific setup scripts

### Activation Hook (`scripts/hooks/activation.sh.example`)
- **Session Type Handling**: Different behavior for new/continue/resume
- **Service Health Checks**: Verify and restart services as needed
- **Environment Loading**: Automatic .env file loading
