   - Context menu overlay positioning (app.go:468)
   - Several TODO comments indicate work in progress

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Module name uses placeholder "your-username" throughout
   - Update import paths for production deployment

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

1. **Adaptive Monitoring**
   - Consider dynamic poll intervals based on activity
   - Implement backoff strategies for idle periods
   - Optimize resource monitoring frequency

2. **Memory Management**
   - Large transition history could benefit from circular buffers
   - Implement periodic cleanup of old state data
   - Consider memory-efficient data structures for long-running sessions

3. **I/O Optimization**
   - More efficient config file watching with debouncing
   - Batch file operations where possible
   - Optimize log parsing performance

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Current security posture is solid
- Consider adding configuration validation for hook scripts
- Audit environment variable exposure in hook execution

### üìà Scalability Enhancements
