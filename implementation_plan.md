# ccmgr-ultra Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development of ccmgr-ultra, a tool designed to streamline code management workflows. Based on the initial requirements analysis, the tool will leverage modern open-source components to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: charm.sh libraries and bubbletea for TUI implementation
- **Language**: To be determined based on requirements
- **Dependencies**: Will utilize established open-source tools for reliability

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Modules
- Architecture design and module structure
- Command-line interface (CLI) specifications
- Terminal user interface (TUI) specifications
- Configuration management system
- Testing framework and plans

### 2. Key Considerations

The following aspects require clarification before proceeding with detailed implementation:

#### Cross-Platform Support
- Determine target operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Identify platform-specific features or limitations
- Plan for consistent behavior across platforms

#### Configuration Format
- Choose between YAML, JSON, or other formats
- Define configuration schema
- Implement validation and error handling

#### Code Editor Compatibility
- Determine which editors to support
- Plan integration methods
- Consider extension/plugin requirements

#### Git Integration
- Define supported Git hosts (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Plan authentication mechanisms
- Design pull request creation workflow

#### Concurrency Requirements
- Identify operations that benefit from parallelization
- Design thread-safe components
- Plan for efficient resource utilization

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize the purpose.md requirements
2. Address the clarifying questions listed above
3. Create detailed module specifications
4. Design the user interface mockups
5. Develop the testing strategy
6. Begin implementation of core components

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for module interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform compatibility tests

## Documentation Plan

- User guide with examples
- API documentation
- Configuration reference
- Contributing guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide
